# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: âœ…Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: âœ… Work out the value of 5% of yesterday's closing stock price.

# Get the date for yesterday an two days ago using datetime module
today = datetime.date.today()
yesterday = today - datetime.timedelta(days=1)

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
