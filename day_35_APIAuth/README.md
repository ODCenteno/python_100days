# Day 35 of 100 days coding with Python

---

Today I'm going to learn about:
* API Authentication and keys.
* Send messages with Python.

The aim is to use the [Open Wheather API](https://openweathermap.org/).
The One Call API provides the following weather data for any geographical coordinates:

* Current weather
* Minute forecast for 1 hour
* Hourly forecast for 48 hours
* Daily forecast for 7 days
* National weather alerts
* Historical weather data for the previous 5 days
