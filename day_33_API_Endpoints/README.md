## Learning about Application Programing Interface (API)

**API**. Is a set of commands , functions, protocols, and objects that programmers
can use to create software or interact with an external system.

**API Endpoint**. The location where the API lives in internet, usually a URL.

**API Request**. 

**HTTP Responses**.
An HTTP response is made by a server to a client. The aim of the response is to provide the client with the resource it requested, or inform the client that the action it requested has been carried out; or else to inform the client that an error occurred in processing its request.

An HTTP response contains:

* A status line.
* A series of HTTP headers, or header fields.
* A message body, which is usually needed.

An example of a response line is:
`HTTP/1.1 200 OK`

HTTP Responses at a glance:

- 1xx. Hold On
- 2xx. Here You GO
- 3xx. Go Away
- 4xx. You Screwed Up
- 5xx. The Server Screwed Up
